This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that accesses a state variable within a nested function. The nested function may not correctly update when the state changes, leading to unexpected behavior and stale closures. This typically manifests as the nested function always using the initial value of the state variable, even after the state updates.
